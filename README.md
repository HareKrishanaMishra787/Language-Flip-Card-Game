## 🛠️ How It Works

- Loads words from `Korian_words.csv` (or `words_to_learn.csv` if available).
- Shows a flashcard with a Korean word first.
- After 3 seconds, flips the card to show the English translation.
- You can mark whether you knew the word or not.
- Updates `words_to_learn.csv` accordingly.
